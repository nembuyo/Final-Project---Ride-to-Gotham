What is it, Hal? #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
* [What are you doing?]
    I just called a boat, because I want to get out of here. #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
    Unlike someone else. #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
    Hey! It's not like I wanted my battery to run out! #speaker:Hal  #portrait:Hal_Angry  #layout:right
    Yeah, whatever. #speaker:Bruce  portrait:Bruce_Neutral  #layout:left
    Go explore or something. #speaker:Bruce  portrait:Bruce_Neutral  #layout:left
    -> DONE
* [I'm bored.]
    How is that my fault? #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Confused #layout:left
        * * [You're just standing there!]
            I'm trying to get us out of here, Hal. Go look around, maybe you'll find a way not to distract me. #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
            Ugh, fine. #speaker:Hal #portrait:Hal_Angry #layout:right
            -> DONE
        * * [Uh, I guess it's not, but...]
            Listen, I'm busy right now. #speaker:Bruce #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
            But I heard some frogs earlier, why don't you go find them? #speaker:Bruce  #portrait:Bruce_Happy #layout:left
            Hmm...#portrait:Hal_Neutral #speaker:Hal #layout:right
            Sure, yeah. #portrait:Hal_Happy #speaker:Hal #layout:right
            Bye Bruce. #portrait:Hal_Happy #speaker:Hal #layout:right
            Have fun. #speaker:Bruce  #portrait:Bruce_Neutral #layout:left
