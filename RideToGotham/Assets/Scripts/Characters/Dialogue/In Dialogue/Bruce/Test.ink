* [What are you doing?] 
    I just called a boat, because I want to get out of here. Unlike someone else. #speaker:Bruce
    Hey! It's not like I wanted my battery to run out! #speaker:Hal
    Yeah, whatever. Go explore or something. #speaker:Bruce
    -> DONE
* [I'm bored.]
    How is that my fault?
        * * [You're just standing there!] 
            I'm trying to get us out of here, Hal. Go look around, maybe you'll find a way not to distract me. #speaker:Bruce
            Ugh, fine. #speaker:Hal
            -> DONE
        * * [Uh, I guess it's not, but...]
            Listen, I'm busy right now. 
            I heard some frogs earlier, why don't you go find them? #speaker:Bruce
            Hmm...sure yeah, bye Bruce. #speaker:Hal
            Have fun. #speaker:Bruce

Bruce is a bit busy right now. #speaker:Bruce
