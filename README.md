# Final-Project---Ride-to-Gotham
A relatively calm and serene game about two heroes just chatting and learning more about each other on their long journey home.
Mechanics and stuff are stated in the about section of the main menu.

In the final scne, Bruce completely breaks for no reason. I'm not really sure why. It says something about value not being assigned, the error, but there's not much I can do about it since there's no value to Be assigned. This only happens in the last scene.

There's some stuff left unpolished because of this above error, and me trying to fix it to no avail, and the game breaking mid working on it. Unity crashed and erased a lot of the progress I'd done, and it wasn't recoverable from github since it involved files being saved to the disk.

Anyway, I hope you like it at the very least.

UPDATE - 2/26/22

Changes were mentioned in the last commit ("update fixes") but just to summarize: Added a Raycast, a GameManager, fixed issues with the Character inheritance and the AudioManager.

Tried to fix the last scene's bug as well, but it didn't really work. Everything else is functional and improved, though!
